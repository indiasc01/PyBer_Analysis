Overview

The overview of this module was to analyze the data for a ridesharing company called Pyber and their total weekly fares. We were given data for the total in rides, drivers, fares, and average fare per ride and driver. We were given a time frame to look from the month of Janurary to April 2019. In order for us to visualize the data, we created a multiple line graph based on total weekly fares for the different city type in the monthly time period.

Results

From the results, we could see that Urban cities has a higher amount of riders compared to the other cities, while rural cities has the least amount of riders. With rural cities not having as much drivers, that can result in not many riders and the average fare per ride is much higher coming in at $34.62 per ride and $55.49 per driver. The next location that has the second highest amount of riders are in suburban cities. With more drivers, they rack in more riders with a total of 625.  With more riders, the total fares increase. Lastly, Urban cities has the highest rate of people using rideshares bringing in a total of 1625 rides with the highest amount of drivers. As there are more drivers, the average fare decreases to $24.53 and the average fare per driver to $16.57.
In the line graph, it shows that the end of February had a higher demand in rideshares throughout all city tpes, which resulted in the increase in fares. We can also determine that urban cities had a higher fare rate in all months compared to the other cities.

Summary

For my analysis of the results calculating the different data types for city types, my three recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types are:
-Urban cities result in the majority revenue for the company as they have the highest amount of riders and the highest total fare. I would suggest including more investments towards urban cities as it shows it is the greater performing city compared to the others.
-Suburban cities are the second highest performing city, and although they are doing well, I would focus on investing in Urban cities as they can continue to grow and rural as there is much more improvement to focus on. Suburban cities show that they can remain consistent.
-With rural cities being the least popular in rideshares, they have the highest fare rate per ride and driver. If you invest more, there could riders if there are more drivers.

Overall, the most popular city type to use a rideshare is in urban cities, while rural cities are the least common to use a rideshare.
